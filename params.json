{"name":"Mkvcast","tagline":"A barebones on the fly video transcoder for Chromecast","body":"# mkvcast\r\nA barebones on the fly video transcoder for [Chromecasts](https://developers.google.com/cast/).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou'll need to have a [whitelisted](https://developers.google.com/cast/whitelisting#whitelist-receiver) Chromecast and a place to host the receiver.html file.\r\n### Modify the receiver app\r\nUpdate the static/receiver.html files with your app id.\r\n\r\nUpload the static/receiver.html file to the URL endpoint you specified when you had your Chromecast whitelisted.\r\n\r\n_Note:_Ideally the Chromecast team will have a basic video player available for everyone to use. Until then, you'll need to host and whitelist your own.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS X\r\nThe easiest way to install this is via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install git\r\nbrew install ffmpeg\r\nbrew install node\r\ngit clone https://github.com/maherbeg/mkvcast.git\r\ncd mkvcast\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm install -g bower\r\nbower install\r\nnode ./lib/mkvcast <config file>\r\nopen 'http://localhost:1338/list'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n### config.json\r\nThe following keys need to be saved in a 'config.json' that is passed into the application.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"applicationId\" : \"Your app ID here\",\r\n    \"mediaDirectories\" : [\r\n        \"/Users/someuser/Downloads/\",\r\n        \"/Volumes/harddrive/Media/\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### mkvcast.config.js\r\nPlace a javascript file in the same directory as where your receiver.html file lives.\r\n```javascript\r\nvar appId = 'Your app ID here';\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n* ~~A responsive sender UI that will show all the files to serve~~ as well as a list of Chromecasts to serve.\r\n* Interface for pausing/playing/setting the volume of the Chromecast\r\n* Better documentation\r\n* Testing\r\n* Playlist functionality\r\n* Channel functionality. Assign a folder list to a channel and serve up random videos from these folders.\r\n\r\n## Things it can't do\r\n* Fast forward/reverse through a video\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPull requests are graciously accepted. Feel free to open up issues as well.\r\n\r\nThis code is MIT Licensed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
